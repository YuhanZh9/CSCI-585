Assumptions & Notes:
Q1:
I am assuming meeting_id and employee_id form a compound attribute, therefore I'm making them both Primary keys.
The date data format is YYYY-MM-DD.
I also included the insert data commands but commented it out.

Q2:
Just making sure if there are multiple symptoms with highest count, they are all shown.

Q3:
As suggested by piazza, I am considering the 'Sickest' floor as floor with most positive cases and symptomatic individuals.
I considered people locating/working on the floor instead of the meeting location.
Also same as Q2, I want to make sure if multiple floors are all 'sickest', they are all shown.

Q4:
Again, I am using date format of YYYY-MM-DD, and I chose 2023-10-06 to 2023-10-09 as start and end date.

Q5:
My question:
How many symptom reports do employees who attended all the meetings with at least 3 people make?

I'm using table division in this question.
